# Modern Robotics Capstone Project

This is my solution to the Capstone project of the
Modern Robotics specialization on Coursera.

The code follows mainly the description and explanations
for the project provided by Coursera.

The only big difference is that the code is structured in
a object-oriented way.

## Run the Code and the Tests

First, create a virtual env:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
pip install -r code/requirements.txt
```


then the code can be run:

```
code/mobile_manipulation.py
```

or run the tests:
```
pytest code/mobile_manipulation.py
```
